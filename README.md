# 🧠 How to Test AI Agents

A complete, hands-on guide to evaluating and validating AI agents through structured testing, measurable metrics, and reproducible experiments.

This repository supports the **“How to Test AI Agents”** course. It contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and templates for functional and non-functional AI agent testing.

## 📘 Overview

Modern AI agents are autonomous systems that plan, reason, and take actions.  
Testing them requires more than checking outputs — it requires **systematic validation of goals, reasoning steps, and behavior**.

This project demonstrates how to test agent performance, reliability, and efficiency using transparent, data-driven methods.
